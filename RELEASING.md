# Releasing

One workflow, `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, fires on a tag. What follows is
the part that is not in the file, plus the four things that have already gone
wrong once.

## Before the tag: the changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is updated **on the commit the tag will point at**, not after.
One entry per occasion, headed by the date and by what the tag releases — a
workspace tag lists the versions it carries (`digline 0.1.3, digline-anthropic
0.1.1, digline-openai 0.1.0`), a named tag heads its own package.

This is the step to do first, because it is the only one the workflow cannot
catch up on. A tag is a commit, and a changelog written afterwards describes a
release from a commit that is not in it: the file on PyPI and on `digline.dev`
stays the one that says nothing about the version somebody just installed.
Fixing that costs a re-tag, which is repeatable but only until the `pypi` job
has run.

## Before the tag: the gates

Run **exactly what CI runs**, from the repository root:

```sh
uv sync --all-packages
uv run pytest -q -m "not live"
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Copied from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and held to it by
`tests/test_releasing.py`, which reads the `gates` job and fails if this block
falls behind it. That test exists because the block went stale the first time it
mattered: v0.2.0 was tagged after a check that ran `ruff` over
`src packages tests` instead of `.`, and CI failed on the tag with a code sample
in `docs/api.md` — **`ruff format` formats the Python blocks inside a Markdown
file**, and no narrower path list ever sees them.

Two of these are easy to think you can skip, and both were the same mistake:

- **`.` and not a list of directories.** `docs/` and `examples/` are checked
  too, and they are where a sample rots.
- **`uv`, not the ambient interpreter.** `uv sync` is what updates `uv.lock`
  after a version bump; a lock still naming the previous version is a lock that
  describes a release that does not exist. Running `ruff` and `pytest` straight
  from a system Python never touches it.

CI also runs the gates on **3.12 and 3.13**. One locally is enough before a
tag — the second is what CI is for — but a failure on 3.13 alone is a real
failure, not a runner quirk.

## The two tag shapes

| Tag | Means |
|---|---|
| `v0.1.3` | a **workspace** release, led by the core |
| `digline-bedrock-v0.1.0` | a **single package**, on its own version line |

Version numbers are per package and they collide: `digline-bedrock` at 0.1.0 has
no `v0.1.0` left to take, because that tag released the core in its own first
version. The named shape exists for exactly that, and it is checked more
strictly — `digline-bedrock-v0.1.0` verifies that *that* package is at that
version, where `v0.1.3` only asks that somebody in the workspace is.

Tags are annotated, with the released versions as the subject:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.3 -m "digline 0.1.3, digline-anthropic 0.1.1, digline-openai 0.1.0"
git tag -a digline-bedrock-v0.1.0 -m "digline-bedrock 0.1.0"
git push origin <tag>
```

**The tag names the occasion; it does not decide the content.** Every package is
built on every tag, and `select_unpublished.py` uploads only what the index does
not already have. So a plugin-only tag publishes only that plugin — because
everything else is already released, not because the tag said so.

## Before the first tag of a *new* package

**Configure its pending publisher on TestPyPI *and* on PyPI.** Both, before
pushing the tag.

A package that has never been released has nothing for trusted publishing to
attach to, and the failure comes at the *end* — after the build, after the
checks, after TestPyPI — with a version number spent on one index and not the
other. This is not something the workflow can check for you: it is a setting in
an account.

## The one secret

`DIGLINE_DEV_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, a repository secret on `digline/digline`.

| | |
|---|---|
| What | fine-grained PAT, **Contents: read and write on `digline/digline.dev` only** — nothing else, no other repository |
| Why | the `site` job posts a `repository_dispatch` to the site's repository, and a workflow's own `github.token` is scoped to *this* one |
| Where | Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, and it is read on the step, not the job |
| Created | 2026-08-31 |
| Expires | **fine-grained PATs always expire.** Record the date here when you create or rotate one — a year from now this page is the only thing standing between an expired token and an afternoon |

It fails at the **end** of a release, after PyPI, and a failure there needs no
re-tag: the packages are published, and only the site is behind. Add or renew
the secret and re-run the failed job.

**A re-run replays the workflow file from the tag's commit, not from `main`.**
So a fix pushed to `main` does not reach a re-run of an older release — for that
one, either the secret has to match the name *that* commit expects, or the
dispatch is sent by hand:

```sh
gh api repos/digline/digline.dev/dispatches --method POST \
  -f event_type=digline-release -f 'client_payload[ref]'=v0.2.0
```

## Two failures already paid for

**A plugin wheel cannot resolve the core from the index on the tag that releases
them together.** `digline-anthropic` requires `digline>=0.1.3`, which is not
published yet at the moment the build job checks that each wheel installs on its
own. Hence `--find-links dist/` on those installs: the core is resolved from the
wheel built beside it, while the index stays reachable for `anthropic`, `openai`
and `boto3`.

**A loop that installs every wheel leaves only the last one installed.** "The
last one imports" is not the check anybody meant to write, so each plugin is
imported in a venv of its own, with the core wheel passed in explicitly.

## What is irreversible, and what is not

A version on an index can never be reused. That is why the `pypi` job sits
behind a required reviewer, and why a mistyped tag is the one mistake here with
no repair — the check that refuses a tag naming no package exists for that
alone.

Everything before PyPI is repeatable. A tag can be deleted and re-pushed on a
fixed commit: the run starts over, and whatever reached TestPyPI in the meantime
is skipped rather than re-uploaded.

`digline.dev` is rebuilt only on a `v*` tag. The site describes what the core
says — the quickstart, the format, `docs/` — and a plugin release changes none
of it.
